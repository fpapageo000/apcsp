    <br>
    <p>My name is Foti Papageorge and I am a 17 year old Senior at Waukesha West High School in Waukesha, Wisconsin.
I have been interested in computers since I got my first laptop in 6th grade, and I've been learning code since I was a freshman.
I plan to major in either Civil Engineering or City/Urban Planning, as I am very interested in the design of cities and urban areas, which is why I chose to visit New York City over the summer with my family. <img src="images/me.jpg" width="500" height="350" align="left"></p>
